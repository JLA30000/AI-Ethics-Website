            Artificial intelligence learns and trains from existing data, then
            predicts, classifies, or generates content. AI is a powerful tool,
            but it isn&apos;t magic. Its output is defined by the training data
            that people give it, thus AI is prone to the same human errors and
            biases.

              According to the Guest Column article "AI-proof careers - Essential
              skills for AI-resilient workforce", many IT companies like TCS and
              Wipro have laid off thousands of employees because their jobs can
              be performed by AI. AI has the potential to replace low-level
              programmers, call center executives, and other jobs where
              automation can lead to the machine replacing the man behind the
              machine.

              immediately banned AI usage in schoolwork over fear of cheating.

              Salman Khan says AI will help reduce educational barriers.
              Classes move at a scheduled pace, but AI can act as a free tutor
              that helps students fill in the gaps in their learning and learn
              at their own pace. If a student struggles with homework, they can
              consult AI to help. If an adult needs to learn a new topic, AI is
              always there, even if they just want to have a tool to find
              strong resources.

              <p>
                A short video on ABC news titled "AI-based job application
                selection process may present legal risks" discusses the issue
                of AI biases. According to the video, research by AI experts
                has found that people who are traditionally disadvantaged in
                the workforce, such as those with a disability, tend to be
                discriminated against by AI algorithms for job applications.
                An indigenous woman is suing the company HireVue because she
                believes that the AI video interview is biased. AI is only as
                reliable as its training data, which has very real biases that
                are making a negative impact.
              </p>
              <p>
                According to the Spectator article "The Urgent Case of AI
                Regulation", AI has the potential to cause discrimination and
                even damage democracies. Researchers at the Distributed AI
                Research Institute have reported countless cases where AI acted
                racist or sexist.

                The World Health Organization issued a call for "safe and
                ethical AI" to protect the wellbeing of all people. Even large
                tech CEOs like Elon Musk and Steve Wosniak both signed a
                document attempting to halt the development of AI models more
                advanced than GPT-4.

              <p>
                Don&apos;t rely on AI for everything. According to Redmond High
                School AP CSA Teacher Mr. Methvin, the two most common
                misconceptions that people have about AI are that it&apos;s always
                right and that it&apos;s free. According to the article "Regulate AI -
                for the Sake of Our Jobs, Brains, and Planet", AI produces a lot
                of misinformation, especially in very technical fields. According
                to analyst Sophie McLean, a conversation of 20-50 questions with
                ChatGPT can result in over 500 mL of water being consumed.
                According to the United Nations Environment Programme, AI data
                centers use massive amounts of electricity and consume enormous
                amounts of water and minerals. As AI usage becomes more global,
                the amount of resources that AI consumes will drastically
                increase, and this will damage our natural environment.
              </p>
              <p>
                The most dangerous consequence that results from over-dependence
                on AI is the reduction of our own critical thinking skills. If
                AI does every task for you, your ability to think and solve
                problems on your own will decrease as that&apos;s not a skill you
                require anymore. If more and more people sync their thinking
                process with AI, a severe reduction in the diversity of thought
                will occur. Every historical breakthrough has come as a result
                of human innovation and if that skill is decreased, the
                likelihood that we will face a problem that no one will be able
                to solve will greatly increase.
